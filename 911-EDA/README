#📊 911 Emergency Calls - Exploratory Data Analysis
# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 911 emergency calls to uncover insights about the most common types of emergencies, their frequency across different days, months, and hours, and trends over time. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to visualize and better understand the data.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – for data cleaning and manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

# 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information about 911 emergency calls, including:

title – type of emergency (Fire, Traffic, Medical, etc.)

timeStamp – date and time of the call

lat, lng – geographic location (latitude & longitude)

zip – zipcode where the call was reported

Other relevant attributes

# 🔑 Key Steps in the Analysis

Data Loading & Inspection

Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame

Check for missing values, data types, and basic statistics

Feature Engineering

Extract Reason from title (e.g., Fire, Medical, Traffic)

Convert timeStamp to datetime format

Create new columns: Hour, Month, Day of Week

Exploratory Data Analysis

Most common zip codes and reasons for 911 calls

Frequency of calls by day of week, month, and hour

Trends in number of calls per month

Heatmaps and count plots to show relationships between time and reason

Data Visualization

Countplots for categorical distributions

Line plots to show trends over months

Heatmaps for call frequency by day/hour

Regression plots to detect seasonal patterns

# 📊 Insights

Medical emergencies are the most common reason for calls.

Certain weekdays (like Friday & Saturday) see higher call volumes.

Calls show time-of-day patterns, peaking in the afternoon and evening.

Clear seasonal trends can be seen across months.
